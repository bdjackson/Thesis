This thesis presents a search for direct scalar top pair production where
the scalar tops decay via an $R$-parity-violating coupling to a
final state with two leptons and two identified $b$-jets.
The analysis uses 20.3 \ifb\ of $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV proton-proton
collision data collected with the \atlas\ detector at the LHC.
No significant excess is observed over the Standard Model background.
Assuming a supersymmetric minimal $B-L$ extension to the Standard Model,
limits on the scalar top mass are placed between 500~GeV and 1~TeV with a
branching fraction above 20\% for the scalar top to decay to an
electron or a muon and a $b$-quark.
