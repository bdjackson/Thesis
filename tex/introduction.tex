This thesis describes the search for direct scalar top pair production, with
the decay of each stop via an $R$-parity-violating (RPV) interaction to a
charged lepton (electron or muon) and a $b$-quark, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:blstop_diagram}.
The analysis uses 20.3~\ifb of $\sqrt{s}=8~\TeV$ proton-proton collision data
collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

The experimental signature is two oppositely charged leptons and two identified
$b$-jets.
The analysis considers $eebb$, $e \mu bb$, and $\mu \mu bb$ final states.
Final states with $\tau$ leptons are not considered for this search.
The distinguishing features are two pairs, each of a lepton and a $b$-jet, with
a resonance in the invariant mass distribution of each pair.
In contrast to $R$-parity conserving searches, there is no significant missing
transverse momentum.

Previous searches for lepto-quarks at ATLAS~\cite{ATLAS:2013oea,
ATLAS:2012aq, Aad:2011ch, Aad:2011uv} and
CMS~\cite{Khachatryan:2014ura, CMS:2014qpa, Chatrchyan:2012sv,
Chatrchyan:2012vza} have considered pair production of first, second,
and third generation lepto-quarks, but have not examined the signature
of a resonance in the invariant mass of an electron and a $b$-jet or a
muon and a $b$-jet.  The results of these searches have already been
interpreted to set limits on the stop mass and its decay
branching fractions in the $B-L$
model~\cite{Marshall:2014cwa, Marshall:2014kea}.

Chapter~\ref{ch:theory} describes of the Standard Model (SM) of
particle physics and Supersymmetry, a popular extension to the SM.
The concept of $R$-parity, and the $B-L$ extension to the SM is also discussed
in this chapter.
Emphasis is placed on the phenomenology of this model.

Chapter~\ref{ch:lhc} introduces the LHC and ATLAS, along with the triggering
system and event reconstruction.
Chapter~\ref{ch:mc} reviews the Monte Carlo event generator tools used for
estimating the detector response and efficiency to reconstruct the signal
process, estimate systematic uncertainties, and to predict the backgrounds
from SM processes.

Chapters~\ref{ch:bl_stop} and~\ref{ch:results} describe the stop search.
Chapter~\ref{ch:bl_stop} reviews the search strategy, event selection, and
Chapter~\ref{ch:results} presents the results and interpretation.
