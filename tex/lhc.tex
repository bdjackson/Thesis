\label{ch:lhc}

\begin{quote}
  As the name suggests, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle collider,
  which collides particles at very high energies.
  There are four major experiments, including \atlas, which collect and study
  data generated from these particle collisions in an effort to study
  the properties of nature, and search for signs of physics beyond the Standard
  Model.
  This chapter gives a brief introduction to the LHC machine, and the
  \atlas\ experiment.

\section{The LHC machine}
\label{sec:lhc}

The LHC~\cite{cern-jinst-lhc} is circular particle accelerator, with a
circumference of 27~km, built 100~m underground, underneath the French-Swiss
border near the city of Geneva, Switzerland, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:lhc_aerial}.
The LHC is operated by the European Organization for Nuclear Research
(CERN~\footnote{Conseil Europ\'een pour la Recherche Nucl\'eaire}).
The LHC became fully operational in 2010, providing proton-proton collisions
to the experiments along the ring at an unprecedented center-of-mass energy
of 7~\TeV.
In 2012, the energy was increased to 8~\TeV.

  \label{fig:lhc_aerial}
\end{figure}

Four major experiments are positioned around the LHC to collect and analyze
data from the hadron collisions.
The experiments include \atlas~\cite{cern-jinst-atlas},
\cms~\cite{cern-jinst-cms}, \alice~\cite{cern-jinst-alice}, and
\lhcb~\cite{cern-jinst-lhcb}.
\atlas\ and \cms\ are designed to be ``general purpose experiments,'' searching
for physics beyond the Standard Model which may present itself in may ways.
The two experiments complement each other by providing independent results,
which can be verified against the each other.
\alice\ is designed to study the heavy ion (lead nuclei) collisions, studying
the properties of quark-gluon plasma.
The \lhcb\ experiment is primarily interested in studying the physics of
$b$-hadrons.

\subsection{CERN accelerator complex}
\label{sec:accelerator_complex}

The LHC is only the final stage in a series of accelerators, operated by CERN,
used to provide high energy particle collisions.
For proton-proton collisions, protons begin in the Linac 2 linear
accelerator, where they are accelerated to an energy of 50~\MeV\ per proton.
From there, they are fed through several circular accelerators, including
the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB), Proton Synchrotron (PS), and the Super
Proton Synchrotron (SPS), where the protons are accelerated to energies of
1.4~\GeV, 25~\GeV, and 450~\GeV\ respectively.
At this stage, the protons are injected into the LHC accelerator, where 
in 2012, they were accelerated to an energy of 4~\TeV\ per proton, and finally
collided.
A schematic of the CERN accelerator complex, and how they link to one another
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cern_complex}.

\subsection{LHC beam conditions}
\label{sec:beam_conditions}

Rather than a constant stream of protons, the protons in the LHC are separated
into over 1000 bunches, each containing over $10^{11}$ protons.
In each of the interaction points around the LHC ring, proton bunches cross
onces every 50~ns, where each crossing leads to potential collisions between
the constituent protons.
The instantaneous luminosity of collisions in these bunch crossings is given by
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{instantaneous} =
  \frac{N_{1}N_{2} n_b f_\mathrm{rev}}
  {4\pi \sigma_{x} \sigma_{y}}
  F,
\end{equation}
where $N_{1,2}$ are the number of protons per bunch, $n_b$ is the number of
bunches, $f_\mathrm{rev}$ is the frequency at which the protons are revolution
frequency, $\sigma_{x,y}$ is the width of the beam in the transverse directions,
and $F$ is a reduction factor, accounting for the fact that the beams cross
at an angle, rather than head-on.
As the proton beams circulate, and undergo collisions, they tend to spread out,
increasing $\sigma_{x,y}$, and reducing the instantaneous luminosity over time.
Typically, once the LHC is filled with proton beams, and accelerated to their
full energy, they are circulated for several hours before they are dumped, and
the accelerator is filled again.

    Instantaneous luminosity collected by the ATLAS detector throughout
    Run 1~\cite{atlas-lumi}.
  }
  \label{fig:inst_lumi_vs_time}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:inst_lumi_vs_time} shows the instantaneous luminosity of
proton-proton collisions provided to ATLAS by the LHC increased throughout the
running period as the machine was thoroughly tested and better understood.
This is accomplished by adding more protons, and squeezing the beams into
a smaller area for the collisions.
The higher instantaneous luminosity allowed for faster data collection in later
running periods, but came at the cost of a larger number of interactions per
crossing, seen in Figure~\ref{fig:int_lumi_vs_time_and_pileup}.

  }
  \label{fig:atlas_det}
\end{figure}

Along with \cms, \atlas\ is one of the two general purpose experiments, which
collect and analyze data from LHC collisions~\cite{cern-jinst-atlas}.
\atlas\ is located at interaction point 1 of the LHC, across the street from
the CERN Meyrin campus.
The experiment is made up of many ``sub-detectors,'' using an array of
technologies, which work together to reconstruct the collision events.
Figure~\ref{fig:atlas_det} shows a cut-away diagram of the ATLAS experiment,
highlighting the various sub-detectors.
Starting from the interaction point, and moving outward, the sub-detectors
are grouped into three main categories, an inner
detector~(Section~\ref{sec:id}), used to measure the trajectory of charged
particles, the calorimetry system~(Section~\ref{sec:calo}), which records the
energy deposition of particles, and a muon spectrometer~(Section~\ref{sec:ms})
which is used to identify and track muons.
These systems and their components are described in more detain in the coming
sections.

\subsection{Coordinate system} 
\label{sec:coordinate_system}

\atlas\ uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal
interaction point (IP) in the center of the detector and the $z$-axis
along the beam pipe. The $x$-axis points from the IP to the center of the
LHC ring, and the $y$-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates
($R,\phi$) are used in the transverse plane, $\phi$ being the azimuthal
angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the
polar $\theta$ angle as
\begin{equation}
  \eta = -\ln\left[\tan(\frac{\theta}{2})\right].
\end{equation}
The distance parameter (in $\eta$-$\phi$ space)
\begin{equation}
  \Delta R = \sqrt{(\Delta \eta)^2 + (\Delta \phi)^2}
\end{equation}
is used.

    tracker (TRT)~\cite{1748-0221-3-08-S08003}.

The inner detector (ID) makes up the three innermost sub-detectors of ATLAS,
the pixel detector, silicon semiconductor tracker (SCT), and the transition
radiation tracker (TRT), shown in Figure~\ref{fig:id_cartoon}.
All three sub-detectors of the ID work together to reconstruct the trajectory
of charged particles from collision events.
The pixel and SCT detectors use silicon technologies, while he TRT employs
straws filled with a Xenon gas mixture.
The three sub-detectors are described in \Cref{sec:pixel,sec:sct,sec:trt},
and tracking is reviewed in Section~\ref{sec:tracking}.

% \end{figure}

The pixel detector, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pixel_cartoon}, is the closest
sub-detector in \atlas\ to the interaction point.
It uses silicon pixel technology to provide high granularity for precision
tracking.
The detector consists of three barrel layers, at radii of 50.5~mm, 88.5~mm,
and 122.5~mm, and three disks on either side of the barrel, with mean $z$-values
of 495~mm, 580~mm, and 650~mm.
The pixel detector provides coverage up to $|\eta| = 2.5$.
In total, there are $80 \times 10^{6}$ channels in the pixel detector, each 
with a nominal pixel size is 50~\um\ in the $\phi$ dimension, and 400~\um\ in
$z$~\cite{1748-0221-3-07-P07007}.

The SCT, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sct_photo}, is also made of silicon
detectors, but rather than pixels, the SCT uses microstrip technology.
The detector is made up of four double layers in the barrel, and nine
endcap layers on each side of the barrel.
The SCT provides coverage up to $|\eta| = 2.5$.
A charged particle has, on average, eight hits in the SCT, with each hit
in the barrel (endcap) having a resolution of 17~\um\ in the
$r-\phi$~($z-\phi$)~plane, and 580~\um\ in the $z$ ($r$) dimension.
There are 6.3 million read-out channels in the SCT.

    \atlas\ experiment during its commissioning~\cite{Maximilien:889555}.
  }
  \label{fig:trt_module}
\end{figure}

The TRT, shown during the commissioning process in Figure~\ref{fig:trt_module}
makes up the largest and outer layer of the ID, and is used for both tracking
and particle identification.
The TRT covers provides coverage up to $|\eta| - 2.0$.
The TRT employs 350,000 straws filled with a gas mixture made up of
Xe~(70\%), $\text{CO}_2$~(27\%), and $\text{O}_2$~(3\%).
Each straw of the TRT has a 4~mm diameter, and is strung with a gold plated
tungsten alloy wire.
The outer wall of the straws is at a high electric potential, inducing a large
electric field inside the straw.
Charged particles pass through the straw, ionizing the electric field,
resulting is a charge deposition on the wire, and a measurable current.

The TRT has a less precise resolution than the silicon trackers, but a charged
particle track may have more than 30 TRT hits, which can be combined to make
up for for some of the difference in precision.
The TRT barrel has a precision of 130~\um\  in the $r-\phi$ plane, but much
worse resolution $z$ since there is little segmentation in this dimension.

The TRT is also designed for use in particle identification.
Transition radiation (TR) is emitted when a charged particle crosses a boundary
between media with different dielectric constants.
The amount of TR is proportional to the Lorentz~$\gamma$ factor, which is in
turn related to the particle mass.
Electrons are roughly 200 times less massive than pions, so have a higher
probability to emit TR while crossing a boundary.
The space between the TRT straws is filled with radiator material providing
many such boundaries to facilitate TR.
Xe was chosen as the active gas because it has a large absorption cross section
for TR photons.
The absorption of the additional TR photons induces more ionization, and
therefore, more charge to build up on the wire.
All this results in a larger signal, which can be detected by the TRT
front-end electronics.
The TRT operates with two threshold values (low- and high-threshold).
The low threshold is used for tracking, and is tuned for the typical amount of
ionization from a charged particle passing through the TRT straws.
The high threshold is tuned to register the larger signal when the Xe gas
absorbs the TR photons.
The fraction of TRT hits associated with a charged particle track that exceed
the high threshold is a discriminating variable used to identify electrons.

\subsubsection{Tracking} 
\label{sec:tracking}

The ID is used to reconstruct the trajectory of charged particles.
The individual measurements made along the trajectory of the charged particle
are referred to as ``hits.''
Hits from the three ID sub-detectors are combined into tracks using Kalman
filtering tools which account for multiple scattering as a particle traverses
the ID~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2014-047,ATLAS-CONF-2012-042}.

The ID is enclosed inside a solenoid magnet, with a field strength of 2~T.
The magnetic field bends the trajectory of moving charged particles
perpendicular to the field direction according to
$\vec{F} = q \vec{v}\times \vec{B}$.
The magnetic field is pointing along the direction of the beam, so charged
particles coming from the interaction point will form a helix, with radius
of curvature determined by the transverse momentum (\pt).
Particles with low \pt\ will bend more than those with higher \pt.
The \pt\ of charged particle tracks is determined based on the measured radius
of curvature.
\begin{equation}
  \pt = qBr_\mathrm{curvature}
\end{equation}
It should be noted that the charge is not directly measured, but the sign of
the charge is determined based on the direction the particle is bent.
The momentum resolution of the tracking is limited by the position resolution.
As the tracks become more straight, the precision of curvature becomes worse,
resulting in worse momentum resolution for these high-\pt\ tracks.
The relative momentum resolution is proportional to the \pt\ of the that track.

\subsection{Jets} 
\label{sec:jets}

{\color{red} TODO this is the text from the CONF note. Update and expand...}

Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_{t}$
algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp, Cacciari:2005hq} with a radius
parameter $R = $ 0.4 from calibrated clusters of energy deposits in
the calorimeters. The differences in calorimeter response between
electrons, photons and hadrons are taken into account by classifying
each cluster, prior to the jet reconstruction, as coming from an
electromagnetic or hadronic shower on the basis of its shape
\cite{JES}.  The jet energy thus accounts for electromagnetic
and hadronic energy deposits at the cluster level with correction
factors derived from MC simulation.  A further correction,
used to calibrate the jet energy to the scale of its constituent
particles, (JES) \cite{JES,JES2}, is then applied.  The impact of
pileup is accounted for using
a technique, based on jet areas, that provides an event-by-event and
jet-by-jet correction \cite{Cacciari:2007fd}.  Jets are required
to have transverse momentum \pt\ $>$ 40~\GeV\ and $|\eta| < 4.9$.
In order to reduce contamination from jets produced by pileup,
the scalar sum of the \pt\ of the tracks matched to the jet and
originating from the primary vertex must be at least 50\% of the
scalar sum of the \pt\ of all tracks matched to the jet.  This
criterion is only applied to jets with $\pt < 50 \GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.4$.

algorithm that exploits the impact parameters of charged particle
tracks, the parameters of reconstructed secondary vertices, and the
topology of $b$- and $c$-hadron decays inside a jet.  The operating
point corresponds to an overall 80\% $b$-tagging efficiency, as
measured in simulated \TTBAR\ events, a rejection factor of 25 for jets
originating from light quarks or gluons, and a rejection factor of
3 for jets originating from charm quarks.

the negative vector sum of the reconstructed and calibrated physics
objects and the calorimeter energy clusters not associated with reconstructed

$\met$ is used for its magnitude.  The $\met$ calculation is described
elsewhere~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2013-082}.
