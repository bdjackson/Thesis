\label{ch:lhc}

\begin{quote}
  As the name suggests, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle collider,
  which collides particles at very high energies.
  There are four major experiments, including \atlas, which collect and study
  data generated from these particle collisions in an effort to study
  the properties of nature, and search for signs of physics beyond the Standard
  Model.
  This chapter gives a brief introduction to the LHC machine, and the
  \atlas\ experiment.

\section{The LHC machine}
\label{sec:lhc}

The LHC~\cite{cern-jinst-lhc} is circular particle accelerator, with a
circumference of 27~km, built 100~m underground, underneath the French-Swiss
border near the city of Geneva, Switzerland, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:lhc_aerial}.
The LHC is operated by the European Organization for Nuclear Research
(CERN\footnote{Conseil Europ\'een pour la Recherche Nucl\'eaire}).
The LHC became fully operational in 2010, providing proton-proton collisions
to the experiments along the ring at an record high center-of-mass energy
of 7~\TeV.
In 2012, the energy was increased to 8~\TeV.

\end{figure}

Four major experiments are positioned around the LHC to collect and analyze
data from the hadron collisions.
The experiments include \atlas~\cite{cern-jinst-atlas},
\cms~\cite{cern-jinst-cms}, \alice~\cite{cern-jinst-alice}, and
\lhcb~\cite{cern-jinst-lhcb}.
\atlas\ and \cms\ are designed to be ``general purpose experiments,'' searching
for physics beyond the Standard Model which may present itself in many ways.
The two experiments complement each other by providing independent results,
which can be verified against the each other.
\alice\ is designed to study the heavy ion (lead nuclei) collisions, 
including the properties of a quark-gluon plasma.
The \lhcb\ experiment is primarily interested in studying the physics of
$b$-hadrons.

\subsection{CERN accelerator complex}
\label{sec:accelerator_complex}

The LHC is only the final stage in a series of accelerators, operated by CERN,
used to provide high energy particle collisions.
For proton-proton collisions, protons begin in the Linac 2 linear
accelerator, where they are accelerated to an energy of 50~\MeV\ per proton.
From there, the protons are fed through several circular accelerators, including
the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB), Proton Synchrotron (PS), and the Super
Proton Synchrotron (SPS), where the protons are accelerated to energies of
1.4~\GeV, 25~\GeV, and 450~\GeV\ respectively.
At this stage, the protons are injected into the LHC accelerator, where 
in 2012, they were accelerated to an energy of 4~\TeV\ per proton, and finally
collided.
A schematic of the CERN accelerator complex, and how the individual
accelerators link to one another is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cern_complex}.

\subsection{LHC beam conditions}
\label{sec:beam_conditions}

Rather than a constant stream of protons, the protons in the LHC are separated
into over 1000 bunches, each containing over $10^{11}$ protons.
In each of the interaction points around the LHC ring, proton bunches cross
onces every 50~ns, where each crossing leads to potential collisions between
the constituent protons.
The instantaneous luminosity of collisions in these bunch crossings is given by
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{instantaneous} =
  \frac{N_{1}N_{2} n_b f_\mathrm{rev}}
  {4\pi \sigma_{x} \sigma_{y}}
  F,
\end{equation}
where $N_{1,2}$ are the number of protons per bunch (about $10^{11}$),
$n_b$ is the number of bunches (up to 2808, though only 1404 for
50~ns operation), $f_\mathrm{rev}$ is the revolution frequency of each
bunch (about 11,245~Hz),
$\sigma_{x,y}$ is the width of the beam (about 20~\um\ after being brought
into focus by strong quadrapole magnets near the collision point),
and $F$ is a reduction factor, accounting for the fact that the beams cross
at an angle, rather than head-on.
The proton beams tend to spread over time out as they circulate and undergo
collisions, increasing $\sigma_{x,y}$, and reducing the instantaneous
luminosity.
Typically, the LHC is filled with proton beams at an injection energy of
450~\GeV, then the proton beams are accelerated to the full energy of
4~\TeV\ per beam in 2012, then the two counter-rotating proton beams are
brought into collision for a period of several hours for stable data-taking by
the experiments, and then finally the beams are dumped when the instantaneous
luminosity has fallen below some threshold.

\begin{figure}[th]

  \caption{
    Instantaneous luminosity collected by the ATLAS detector throughout
    Run 1~\cite{atlas-lumi}.
  }
  \label{fig:inst_lumi_vs_time}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:inst_lumi_vs_time} shows that the instantaneous luminosity of
proton-proton collisions provided to ATLAS by the LHC increased throughout the
running period as the machine was thoroughly tested and better understood.
This is accomplished by adding more protons, and squeezing the beams into
a smaller area for the collisions.
The higher instantaneous luminosity allowed for faster data collection in later
running periods, but came at the cost of a larger number of interactions per
crossing, seen in Figure~\ref{fig:int_lumi_vs_time_and_pileup}.

  }
  \label{fig:atlas_det}
\end{figure}

\atlas\ is one of the two general purpose experiments, which
collect and analyze data from LHC collisions~\cite{cern-jinst-atlas}.
\atlas\ is located at interaction point 1 of the LHC, across the street from
the CERN Meyrin campus.
The experiment is made up of many ``sub-detectors,'' using an array of
technologies, which work together to reconstruct the collision events.
Figure~\ref{fig:atlas_det} shows a cut-away diagram of the ATLAS experiment,
highlighting the various sub-detectors.
Starting from the interaction point, and moving outward, the sub-detectors
are grouped into three main categories, an inner
detector~(Section~\ref{sec:id}), used to measure the trajectory of charged
particles, the calorimetry system~(Section~\ref{sec:calo}), which records the
energy deposition of particles, and a muon spectrometer~(Section~\ref{sec:ms})
which is used to identify and track muons.
These systems and their components are described in more detail in the coming
sections.

\subsection{Coordinate system} 
\label{sec:coordinate_system}

\atlas\ uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal
interaction point (IP) in the center of the detector and the $z$-axis
along the beam pipe. The $x$-axis points from the IP to the center of the
LHC ring, and the $y$-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates
($R,\phi$) are used in the transverse plane, $\phi$ being the azimuthal
angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the
polar $\theta$ angle as
\begin{equation}
  \eta = -\ln\left[\tan(\frac{\theta}{2})\right].
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ is preferred over $\theta$ because particle production is roughly
constant in $\eta$ at a hadron collider.
The distance parameter (in $\eta$-$\phi$ space)
\begin{equation}
  \Delta R = \sqrt{(\Delta \eta)^2 + (\Delta \phi)^2}
\end{equation}
is used when measuring the distance between signatures in the detector.

The inner detector (ID) comprises the three innermost sub-detectors of ATLAS,
the pixel detector, silicon semiconductor tracker (SCT), and the transition
radiation tracker (TRT), shown in Figure~\ref{fig:id_cartoon}.
The passage of high energy charged particles is detected from the electron-hole
pairs produced in the silicon semiconductor sensors of the pixel and SCT, and
from the ionization production in the gas-filled straws of the TRT
The three sub-detectors are described in \Cref{sec:pixel,sec:sct,sec:trt},
and tracking is reviewed in Section~\ref{sec:tracking}.

\subsubsection{Pixel detector}

  \label{fig:pixel_cartoon}
\end{figure}

The pixel detector, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pixel_cartoon}, is the closest
sub-detector in \atlas\ to the interaction point.
It uses silicon pixel technology to provide high granularity for precision
tracking.
The detector consists of three barrel layers, at radii of 50.5~mm, 88.5~mm,
and 122.5~mm, and three disks on either side of the barrel, with mean $z$-values
of 495~mm, 580~mm, and 650~mm.
The pixel detector provides coverage up to $|\eta| = 2.5$.
In total, there are $80 \times 10^{6}$ channels in the pixel detector, each 
with a nominal pixel size is 50~\um\ in the $\phi$ dimension, and 400~\um\ in
$z$~\cite{1748-0221-3-07-P07007}.

The SCT, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sct_photo}, is also made of silicon
detectors, but rather than pixels, the SCT uses microstrip technology.
The detector is made up of four double layers in the barrel, and nine
endcap layers on each side of the barrel.
The SCT provides coverage up to $|\eta| = 2.5$.
A charged particle has, on average, eight hits in the SCT, with each hit
in the barrel (endcap) having a resolution of 17~\um\ in the
$r-\phi$~($z-\phi$)~plane, and 580~\um\ in the $z$ ($r$) dimension.
There are 6.3 million read-out channels in the SCT.

\subsubsection{Transition radiation tracker} 
\label{sec:trt}

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \caption{
    Photograph of the transition radiation tracker of the
    \atlas\ experiment during its commissioning~\cite{Maximilien:889555}.
  }
  \label{fig:trt_module}
\end{figure}

The TRT, shown during the commissioning process in Figure~\ref{fig:trt_module}
makes up the largest and outer layer of the ID, and is used for both tracking
and particle identification.
The TRT covers up to $|\eta| = 2.0$.
The TRT employs 350,000 straws filled with a gas mixture made up of
Xe~(70\%), $\text{CO}_2$~(27\%), and $\text{O}_2$~(3\%).
Each straw of the TRT is 4~mm in diameter and has at its center a
30~\um\ diameter gold-plated tungsten wire at ground potential.
The outer wall of the straw is a cathode at $-1530~\mathrm{V}$, leading to
an electric field that separates the ionized electrons and ions, and a large
gas gain of $2.5 \times 10^{4}$ in the high field region close to the wire.

The TRT has a less precise resolution than the silicon trackers, but a charged
particle track may have more than 30 TRT hits and a large lever arm out
to 1.1~m from the beamline
The TRT barrel has a precision of 130~\um\  in the $r-\phi$ plane, but much
worse resolution $z$ since there is little segmentation in this dimension.

The TRT is also designed for use in particle identification.
Transition radiation (TR) is emitted when a charged particle crosses a boundary
between media with different dielectric constants.
The amount of TR is proportional to the Lorentz~$\gamma$ factor, which is in
turn related to the particle mass.
Electrons are roughly 200 times less massive than pions, so have a higher
probability to emit TR while crossing a boundary.
The space between the TRT straws is filled with radiator material providing
many such boundaries to facilitate TR.
Xe was chosen as the active gas because it has a large absorption cross section
for TR photons.
The absorption of the additional TR photons induces more ionization, and
therefore, more charge to build up on the wire.
All this results in a larger signal, which can be detected by the TRT
front-end electronics.
The TRT operates with two threshold values (low- and high-threshold).
The low-threshold is used for tracking, and is tuned for the typical amount of
ionization from a charged particle passing through the TRT straws.
The high-threshold is tuned to register the larger signal when the Xe gas
absorbs the TR photons.
The fraction of TRT hits associated with a charged particle track that exceed
the high-threshold is a discriminating variable used to identify electrons.

\subsubsection{Tracking} 
\label{sec:tracking}

The ID is used to reconstruct the trajectory of charged particles.
The individual measurements made along the trajectory of the charged particle
are referred to as ``hits.''
Hits from the three ID sub-detectors are combined into tracks using Kalman
filtering tools which account for multiple scattering as a particle traverses
the ID~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2014-047,ATLAS-CONF-2012-042}.

The ID is enclosed inside a solenoid magnet, with a field strength of 2~T.
The magnetic field bends the trajectory of moving charged particles
perpendicular to the field direction according to
$\vec{F} = q \vec{v}\times \vec{B}$.
The magnetic field is pointing along the direction of the beam, so charged
particles coming from the interaction point will form a helix, with radius
of curvature determined by the transverse momentum (\pt).
Particles with low \pt\ will bend more than those with higher \pt.
As the particle \pt\ increases, the track becomes closer to a straight line.
The \pt\ of charged particle tracks is related to the radius of curvature by
\begin{equation}
  \pt = q \cdot B \cdot r.
\end{equation}
It should be noted that we actually measure the sagitta of the arc (which is
the amount the measured arc bows from a cord) for the hits on a particle's
trajectory.
The sagitta is inversely proportional to the radius of
curvature ($s=\frac{L^2}{8r}$ where L is the length of the cord, or lever-arm)
and $s$ is the sagitta).
Thus the uncertainty on the \pt\ is proportional to the square of the \pt.
This is usually written as the relative momentum resolution being proportional
to the \pt\ of the particle ($\frac{\Delta \pt}{\pt} \propto \pt$).
The uncertainty on the sagitta decreases with better position resolution for
each hit, higher number of hits, stronger magnetic field and larger radius for
tracking.
Although the position resolution of the TRT is worse per hit than for the
silicon detectors, the TRT does provide a large number of hits (about 30) per
track and doubles the active tracking radius.
The TRT is in fact critical to obtaining the best possible momentum resolution
at high~\pt.

\subsection{Calorimetry}

    The calorimetry system is comprises the electromagnetic calorimeter,
    and a hadronic calorimeter~\cite{cern-jinst-atlas}.
  }
  \label{fig:calo_cartoon}
\end{figure}

The calorimetry system, situated outside the ID and the solenoid, is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:calo_cartoon}.
The calorimetry systems of \atlas\ are designed to complement one another and
offer full coverage in the $\phi$, and pseudorapidity coverage up to
$|\eta| = 4.9$.
The objective of the calorimeters is to stop particles like electrons, photons,
and hadrons and measure their energy.
\atlas\ uses ``sampling calorimeters,'' which absorb a fraction of the total
energy, and must infer the full shower energy.
This is achieved using a dense absorber material to initiate a shower, and
an active material to sample the energy deposition.

The calorimetry system is broken up into three sub-systems, the electromagnetic
calorimeter (EM calorimeter), the hadronic calorimeter, and the forward
calorimeter (FCal).
Each of the sub-systems employ different absorber and active materials.

A calorimeter samples the scintillation light or ionization from the charged
particles in the shower, and the number of charged particles in the shower
increases with energy.
Thus the relative energy resolution of the calorimeter is inversely proportional
to the square root of the incident particle's energy
($\frac{\Delta E}{E} \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{E}}$).
It is important to note that the energy resolution of calorimeters improves
with increasing energy, while the momentum resolution of tracking detectors
worsens with increasing \pt.
Thus the relative energy resolution of electrons and jets will improve with
increasing energy, while the relative momentum resolution of muons will worsen
with increasing \pt.

\subsubsection{Electromagnetic calorimeter} 
\label{sec:ecal}

The EM calorimeter is used to stop and measure the energy of electrons,
positrons, and photons.
It is broken into a barrel component, covering $|\eta| < 1.5$, and two endcaps,
covering $1.4 < |\eta| < 3.2$.
Lead plates are used as an absorber material, and the active material is
liquid argon (LAr).
A pre-sampler is installed in the region $|\eta| < 1.8$ to sample energy from
showers initiated before the first absorber plate.

The active material is arranged in an accordion-style geometry to ensure full
coverage in $\phi$.
The barrel region is further sub-divided into three layers, with differing
granularity.
The first layer has the finest granularity, being arranged in strip-shaped
cells with $\Delta\eta \times \Delta\phi = 0.025/8 \times 0.1$.
This level of granularity provides good position resolution, which is useful
in particle identification to discriminate between photons and neutral pions.
The second layer is arranged in square cells, measuring
$\Delta\eta \times \Delta\phi = 0.025 \times 0.025$.
Layer 2 is the thickest layer, with 16 radiation lengths.
The third layer is coarser than the previous
layers~($\Delta\eta \times \Delta\phi = 0.050 \times 0.025$), and is used to
capture any remaining energy from the electromagnetic shower.

\subsubsection{Hadronic calorimeter}

The hadronic calorimeter is also broken up into barrel and endcap sections, but
in this case, the two regions use different materials.
The barrel section covers a region with $|\eta| < 1.7$, and uses steel
absorbers and scintillating tiles as an active material.
The endcaps use copper plates as an absorber material, and LAr for the active
material.
The hadronic calorimeter endcaps span $1.5 < |\eta| < 3.2$.
% Since the hadronic calorimeter is not used in particle identification, it is
% much coarser than the EM calorimeter, with granularity

  \label{fig:ms_cartoon}
\end{figure}

The muon spectrometer (MS) comprises the four sub-detectors of the
\atlas\ experiment furthest from the interaction point, and is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:ms_cartoon}.
% Muons are minimum ionizing particle, and if they have sufficient energy, are
% able to pass through the calorimetry system unstopped.
Unlike electrons, muons are too massive to lose energy by radiation in the
calorimeters.
Muons only lose a very small amount of energy by ionization in the calorimeters
and escape the calorimeters into the muon spectrometer.
The MS has coverage up to $|\eta| = 2.7$, and is designed to make precision
tracking measurements of the muon trajectory and momentum.
A strong magnetic field is generated by eight large toroidal magnets in the
barrel, and two endcap toroid systems.
The magnetic field is situated such that the muons bend in the $\eta$
direction.
The four sub-detectors of the MS are
\begin{description}
  \item[Monitored drift tubes (MDTs):] 
    Approximately 370,000 drift tubes, each with diameter of 30~mm, and made of
    aluminum with a wire in the middle.
    The gas in the tube is ionized in the presence of a muon, and attracted to
    the wire in the center of the tube, leading to a measurable signal, which
    is read out by the electronics.
    The MDTs span the full range of the MS system, $|\eta| < 2.7$.
  \item[Cathode strip chambers (CSCs):] 
    Chambers, consisting anode wires and cathode strips.
    As a muon passes through a CSC, the gas within the chamber is ionized, and
    drifts toward the cathode strips, where the signal is read out.
    The relative size of the signal on adjacent strips is used to determine the
    location of the hit.
    The CSCs are located closer to the interaction point than the MDTs, in the
    region $2.0 < |\eta| < 2.7$.
  \item[Resistive plate chambers (RPCs):] 
    Consist of two resistive plates with a small gap, filled with gas.
    The gas is ionized in the presence of a muon, and drifts toward one of the
    plates.
    This results in a fast signature that can be used for triggering.

    A multiple wire proportional counter used for triggering in the endcap
    region.

\section{Trigger system}

In 2012, the LHC delivered proton collisions every 50~ns, corresponding to
20~MHz.
Not only are most of these collisions already well-understood, \atlas\ does not
have the bandwidth or computing resources to read out every event, and
reconstruct them for offline use.
The trigger system uses a three step process to select only the rare
potentially interesting events to reduce the data rate to something manageable.

The \atlas\ trigger system includes a level 1 (L1) trigger, implemented in
hardware, which is required to be fast.
Only information from the calorimetry system and the MS is used in the L1
trigger since tracking takes too long to process.
The second (level 2) and third (event filter) stages are referred to,
collectively, as the high level trigger (HLT), and are implemented in computer
farms, away from the \atlas\ detector.
These still have strict latency requirements, but they are allowed to take
more time than L1.
The level 2 stage includes the information in a region of interest (ROI)
produced by the L1 trigger, and the event filter is able to use the full
detector information, and run full event reconstruction.
The specifications of each trigger level are given in
Table~\ref{tab:trigger_specs}.

Particles created during collision events, and their decay products leave
signatures in the various sub-detectors of \atlas.
In order to perform a physics analysis, these detector signatures are identified
translated into reconstructed objects with calibrated momentum and energy
measurements.
Figure~\ref{fig:particle_signatures} shows a simplified diagram of the
detector signatures left by various classes of particles.

The analysis described in this thesis relies on identified
electrons~(Section~\ref{sec:electrons}), muons~(Section~\ref{sec:muons}),
jets~(Section~\ref{sec:jets}), and missing transverse
momentum~(Section~\ref{sec:met}).
Flavor tagging~(Section~\ref{sec:flavor_tagging}) is also used to identify the
jets originating from the decay of $B$-hadrons.
These signatures are described in more detail in the upcoming sections.

\subsection{Electrons} 
\label{sec:electrons}

Electrons pass through the inner detector, leaving behind hits, and deposit a
shower of energy in the EM calorimeter.
The hits are combined to form a track, as described in
Section~\ref{sec:tracking}, which points toward the EM shower.
This signature can be faked by many charge particles, such as charged pions, so
selection criteria are placed on the track and the shower shape to ensure the
particle is indeed an electron.
For instance, the EM shower from electrons is expected to be narrow, and the
shower is expected to be fully absorbed within the EM calorimeter, resulting in
little to no energy in the hadronic calorimeter.
Additionally, electrons are more likely to emit TR photons while traversing
through the TRT, resulting in some of the TRT hits passing the high-threshold.
Heavier particles will have fewer high-threshold hits, so a requirement is
placed on the fraction of TRT hits exceeding this high-threshold.

\subsection{Muons} 
\label{sec:muons}

Muons are the only charged particle able to reach the outermost
detectors of \atlas\ (the MS) while deposit little energy in the calorimetry
system.
A muon is identified as a track in the ID, and a track in the MS, which are
consistent with one another.
Quality criteria are placed on both the ID and MS track segments.
The analysis described in this thesis uses the \textit{Staco Combined}
algorithm, which takes the two track segments as inputs, and performs
a statistical combination to obtain a combined muon track.

\subsection{Jets} 
\label{sec:jets}

Quarks and gluons produced during a proton-proton collision will hadronize,
producing a collimated shower of charged and neutral hadrons.
This spray of hadrons is collectively referred to as a jet.
Jets are reconstructed using the anti-$k_{t}$
algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp, Cacciari:2005hq} with a radius
parameter $R = $ 0.4 from calibrated clusters of energy deposits in
the calorimeters.
The differences in calorimeter response between electrons, photons and hadrons
are taken into account by classifying each cluster, prior to the jet
reconstruction, as coming from an electromagnetic or hadronic shower on the
basis of its shape~\cite{JES}.
The jet energy thus accounts for electromagnetic and hadronic energy deposits
at the cluster level with correction factors derived from MC simulation.
A further correction, used to calibrate the jet energy to the scale of its
constituent particles, JES~\cite{JES,JES2}, is then applied.
The impact of pileup is accounted for using a technique, based on jet areas,
that provides an event-by-event and jet-by-jet
correction~\cite{Cacciari:2007fd}.
% Jets are required to have transverse momentum \pt\ $>$ 40~\GeV\ and
% $|\eta| < 4.9$.

In order to reduce contamination from jets produced by pileup,
the scalar sum of the \pt\ of the tracks matched to the jet and
originating from the primary vertex must be at least 50\% of the
scalar sum of the \pt\ of all tracks matched to the jet.
This criterion is only applied to jets with $\pt < 50 \GeV$ and
$|\eta| < 2.4$.

\subsubsection{Flavor tagging} 
\label{sec:flavor_tagging}

Jets originating from $B$-hadrons can be distinguished from those originating
from light quarks and gluons due to the relatively long lifetime
of around 1.5~ps.
For example, a $B$-hadron with mass 5~\GeV\ and energy of 100~\GeV\ would have
a time dilation gamma factor ($\nicefrac{E}{m}$) of about 20, so it would
travel about 9~mm before decaying into several particles.
The identification of $b$-jets uses the MV1 flavor tagging
algorithm~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2014-004, ATLAS-CONF-2014-046}, which is
based on an artificial neural network algorithm that exploits the impact
parameters of charged particle tracks from the decay products of the
$B$-hadrons, the parameters of reconstructed
secondary vertices, and the topology of $b$- and $c$-hadron decays inside a
jet.
The operating point corresponds to an overall 80\% $b$-tagging efficiency, as
measured in simulated \TTBAR\ events, a rejection factor of 25 for jets
originating from light quarks or gluons, and a rejection factor of
3 for jets originating from charm quarks.

\subsection{Missing energy} 
\label{sec:met}

Some particles such as neutrinos, and potentially new particles such as
neutralinos, do not interact with the detector at all, and instead escape
without being measured at all.
The existence of these particles can be identified as an imbalance in vector
sum of the momentum in an event, obtained from the negative vector sum of the
reconstructed calibrated physics objects and ``soft terms,'' consisting of
calorimeter energy clusters not associated with reconstructed objects.
This is denoted as missing transverse momentum, and the symbol
$\met$ is used for its magnitude~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2013-082}.

Conservation of momentum before and after the collision can be used to infer
the momentum of the missing particles.
This works well in the transverse plane to the beam, where the initial
transverse momentum of the beams is zero, but not along the beamline since the
fraction of momentum carried by the colliding constituents of the proton is
unknown.
