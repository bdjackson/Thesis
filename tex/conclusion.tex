This thesis describes the search for direct scalar top production where the
scalar tops decay via an $R$-parity-violating coupling to a final state with
two leptons and two identified $b$-jets.
The search uses 20.3 \ifb of $\sqrt{s}=8 \TeV$ proton-proton data collected
with the ATLAS detector at the LHC.
No significant excess of events over the Standard Model prediction is observed,
and limits are set on the mass of the scalar top at 95\% confidence level.
A scan of possible stop branching fractions are tested, the mass limit ranges
between 500~\GeV, when the stop has a branching fraction to a $b$-quark and a
tau lepton of 80\%, to to 1~\TeV when the stop decays entirely to a $b$-quark
and an electron.

With the upcoming Run-II of the Large Hadron Collider, the collisions will have
a center-of-mass energy of 13~\TeV, resulting in a huge gain in the expected
cross section for scalar top pair production.
This analysis, will benefit from the higher cross section, and will be able to
test higher stop masses.
Hopefully, the future LHC runs will find signs of new physics beyond the
Standard Model!
