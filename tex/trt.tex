        {The transition radiation tracker}
\label{ch:trt}

{\color{red}Maybe this chapter should be folded into the LHC and ATLAS chapter.
  My initial thought was that I would expand a lot more on the TRT than the
    other sub-detectors, so it may warrant its own chapter}

\section{TRT tracking and calibration}

{\color{red}This section should talk about how the TRT operates, going into
  what happens as a charged particle passes through the straw, and deposits
  charge, and ultimately creates a signal. Then, I can get into $rt$ curves
  and tracking performance.}

\section{TRT timing resolution}

{\color{red}Summarize my work on TRT timing resolution. I need to go back and
  review this! Talk about event time, etc.}

%% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Particle identification}

{\color{red}I know less about this than TRT tracking, but since it's one of the
  main functions of the TRT, I think it's important to at least discuss this
    briefly}
