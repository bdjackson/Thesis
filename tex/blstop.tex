\section{Object selection}
\label{sec:object_selection}

Events are required to have at least two light leptons (electrons or muons)
with opposite charge, and two $b$-tagged jets.
The object selection is performed in multiple steps. First, lepton and jet
objects are reconstructed using detector signatures as described in
Sections~\ref{sec:elctrons},~\ref{sec:muons},~and~\ref{sec:jets}.
Baseline requirements are applied to remove poorly reconstructed objects.
Also, all baseline objects are required to have $\ET(\pt) \geq 40 \GeV$ since the
stop signatures of interest tend to produce high momentum decay products.

Baseline electrons must satisfy the \texttt{Medium++} identification
requirement and have $|\eta| \leq 2.47$.
A requirement of $\DZEROSIG \leq 3$ and
$\ZZEROSINTHETA \leq 0.4$ mm
was placed on the impact parameter to reject electrons coming from secondary
vertices.
The baseline electron requirements are outlined in
Table~\ref{tab:baseline_el_def}.

Baseline muons are selected from the \texttt{STACO} muon collection, and
required to pass the \texttt{Loose} identification requirement. The baseline
muons must also have $|\eta| \leq 2.5$ 
Impact parameter requirements of $\DZEROSIG \leq 3$ and
$\ZZEROSINTHETA \leq 1$ mm are applied to reduce the contamination of muons
from secondary vertices and cosmic rays.
Additional requirements are applied on the number of hits in the ID to ensure
high quality tracks.
These  hit requirements include at least one hit on track in both the B layer
and the Pixel detector.
The ID track must also have at least 5 hits in the SCT, at most 2 missing 
hits-on-track (holes) in both the Pixel detector and the SCT. 
If the muon has $|\eta| \leq 1.9$, there must additionally be at least 6 TRT
hits, of which no more than 90\% are outliers.
Otherwise, no requirement is placed on the number of TRT hits.
The baseline muon requirements are outlined in Table~\ref{tab:baseline_mu_def}.

After selecting baseline leptons and jets, overlap between baseline objects are
is removed to prevent a single detector signature from being included in
multiple particle collections. 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\Delta R(e,e) \le 0.05$: If two baseline electrons fall
    within a cone of $\Delta R(e,e) \le 0.05$, the electron with the
    lower \ET\ is removed from the event.
  \item $\Delta R(e,\mathrm{jet}) \le 0.20$: If a remaining electron and a jet
    are within a cone of $\Delta R(e,\mathrm{jet}) \le 0.20$, it is
    assumed that the electron is also reconstructed as a jet, and the
    jet is removed from the event.
  \item $\Delta R(\ell,\mathrm{jet}) \le 0.40$: If remaining lepton (electron
    or muon) and a remaining jet are within a cone of
    $\Delta R(\ell,\mathrm{jet}) \le 0.40$, the reconstructed lepton is assumed
    to be a constituent of the jet, and is removed from the event.
  \item $\Delta R(e,\mu) \le 0.01$: If a remaining electron and a remaining muon
    are within $\Delta R(e,\mu) \le 0.01$, both are removed from the event.
  \item $\Delta R(\mu,\mu) \le 0.05$: If two remaining muons are within
    $\Delta R(\mu,\mu) \le 0.05$, both are removed from the event.
\end{enumerate}

To reject leptons coming from low mass resonances, the invariant mass of any
remaining same-flavor lepton pairs with opposite charge is computed.
If the invariant mass of any of these pairs is less than 12~\GeV, both leptons
are removed from the event.

Additional requirements are placed on the leptons and jets after overlap
removal to select the final ``signal'' objects.
The scalar sum of the momentum of all tracks with $\pt \geq 400 \GeV$
within a cone of $\Delta R \leq 0.30$ of a lepton ($\pt^\mathrm{cone30}$) is
used to determine if the lepton is isolated.
Both electrons and muons require
$\nicefrac{\pT^{\mathrm{cone30}}}{\min(p_T, 60 \GeV)} \leq 0.1$ in order
to be declared signa leptons.
Jets must pass a tighter cut of $|\eta| \leq 2.4$, and be tagged as a $b$-jet
using the 80\% working point of $\mathrm{MV1} \geq 0.3511$

Events are required to have at least two signal leptons and two $b$-tagged jets.
If more are found, the event is kept, but only the two signal leptons and two
$b$-tagged jets with the highest \pt\ are selected.
Furthermore, the two highest \pt\ leptons are required to have opposite charge.

To construct the mass of each of the $b\ell$ pairs, the leptons and $b$-tagged
jets must be paired.
It is possible to exploit the fact that in the target signal model, each
$b\ell$ pair comes from a resonant decay of a stop particle, and should
reconstruct the same invariant mass.
Therefore, the pairing which minimizes the difference in mass between the two
$b\ell$ pairs is selected as follows.

The two signal leptons and two $b$-jets are labeled $\ell_0$, $\ell_1$, $b_0$,
and $b_1$.

The masses of all pairings are calculated, and the pairing which gives the 
smallest difference in the mass $|\MBL^\mathrm{a} - \MBL^\mathrm{b}|$
is chosen.
The pairs are then ordered, and relabeled such that the higher mass pair has a
mass of $\MBL^{0}$, and the lower mass pair has a mass of $\MBL^{1}$.
This ensures $\MBL^{0} \geq \MBL^{1}$ by definition.

This heuristic correctly identifies at least one correct pairing of $b$-tagged
jets and leptons in roughly 65-90\% of events in the simulated signal samples
depending on the mass of the simulated stop. The efficiency, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:pairing_eff}, improves once a cut is applied on the mass
asymmetry of the two $b\ell$ pairs as described in Section
\ref{sec:signal_regions}.

\section{Trigger selection}
\label{sec:trigger_selection}

{\color{red} TODO Expand on this a lot}

A combination of four single-lepton triggers are used to select events.

Single-electron and single-muon triggers are used to select events. 
Di-electron and di-muon events are required to pass a single-electron and
single-muon trigger respectively, while electron-muon events are selected if
either or both of the single-lepton triggers are passed.
At least one of the reconstructed leptons is required to be
within $\Delta R \leq 0.15$ of the detector signature found by the trigger.
This trigger requirement is highly efficient for signal events; between 93\%
and 98\% of events depending on the flavor channel.

\section{Signal regions}
\label{sec:signal_regions}

{\color{red} TODO Expand on this, and talk about optimization process}

Two overlapping signal regions (SRs) are defined to search for an excess of
signal-like events, which are inconsistent with the prediction from the
Standard Model alone.
In order to achieve a large expected signal to background ratio in the signal
regions, MC simulation is used to optimize the selection requirements.

The scalar sum of the \pt\ of the two $b$-tagged jets and two leptons (\HT) 
effectively separates the signal processes from the major sources of
Standard Model background.
Events in the SRs are required to have \HT\ above 1100~\GeV.
Events with two same-flavor leptons with invariant mass within 10~\GeV\ of the
$Z$-boson mass are vetoed to reduce the backgrounds from $Z$-boson production.

For the signal model, the invariant masses of the two pairs of a lepton and
$b$-tagged jet should be equal since they are decay products of the
stop/anti-stop. Therefore, for each of the two possible ways to group
two leptons and two $b$-tagged jets into two pairs of a lepton and a
$b$-tagged jet, the difference in the invariant masses is calculated,
($\MBL^0-\MBL^1$), where $\MBL^0$($\MBL^1$) denotes the mass of the
higher (lower)-mass pair. The grouping with the smallest difference
is selected.  The mass asymmetry is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \MBLASYM = 
  \frac{\MBL^0-\MBL^1}{\MBL^0+\MBL^1}.
\end{equation}
The asymmetry should be
close to zero for signal.  Standard Model processes, however, have no
preference for the mass asymmetry.  The SRs require a mass
asymmetry of less than or equal to 0.2.
Finally, $\MBL^0$ is used to define the two SRs.
SR~400 has a requirement of $\MBL^0 \geq 400 \GeV$, and is optimal for lower
stop masses, while SR~600 has a requirement of $\MBL^0 \geq 600 \GeV$, and is
optimal for higher stop masses.

The full selection criteria for the analysis regions is outlined in
Table~\ref{tab:regions} and Figure~\ref{fig:region_coverage}.

\section{Background estimate}
\label{sec:bkg}

The background estimates of the \TTBAR\ and the \ZGAMMAJETS\ backgrounds use
MC simulation normalized in dedicated data control regions (CRs), the top
control region (Top CR) and $Z$ control region ($Z$ CR) respectively.
The remaining backgrounds are estimated using simulation.
Several validation regions (VRs) are defined to validate the extrapolation from
the CRs to regions with different kinematics.

Both the Top CR and $Z$ CR require \HT\ to be less than or equal to
500~\GeV\ to reduce the amount of
signal contamination in the regions. A cut of $\MBLASYM \leq 0.2$ is applied to
match the signal regions, and $\MBL^0$ is required to be above 200 \GeV. No
requirement is made on the invariant mass of the second pair.

The \METSIG\ variable is used to define CRs that are relatively pure 
in \TTBAR\ or \ZGAMMAJETS, where
\begin{equation}
  \METSIG = \frac{\MET}{\sqrt{\HT}}.
\end{equation}
Processes like \TTBAR, with real \MET, tend to have large \METSIG, while
\ZGAMMAJETS, where the \MET\ is from mismeasurement, tend to
have low \METSIG. For this reason, the Top CR requires 
$\METSIG \geq 4 \GeV^{1/2}$ and the $Z$ CR requires
$\METSIG \leq 4 \GeV^{1/2}$.  
The definitions of the CRs, and VRs are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:regions} and Figure~\ref{fig:region_coverage}.

The normalization of the \TTBAR\ and the \ZGAMMAJETS\ backgrounds are
determined using a simultaneous fit, which takes into account
cross-contamination of the different background processes between the
CRs as well as the statistical and systematic
uncertainties (described in Section~\ref{sec:systematics})~\cite{Baak:2014wma}.
The remaining background estimates, due to  single top and other SM processes,
are taken from the MC simulation.
The number of observed events as well as the expected number
of events in each of the CRs and VRs are shown in
Table \ref{tab:bkg_only_fit_results}.
The agreement between the observed number of events and the fitted event
yields in the VRs is summarized in Figure \ref{fig:pull_dist_vr}.
Using the fitted backgrounds, the dominant process in the same-flavor
channels of the SRs is \ZGAMMAJETS\ followed by single top and
\TTBAR. In the $e\mu$ channel, the \ZGAMMAJETS\ background does
not contribute, thus, the largest backgrounds are single top and \TTBAR.
As a result of the fit, the \ZGAMMAJETS\ background is scaled up by
approximately 40\%. Due to this large normalization factor, the background is
over-predicted in the $Z$ VR. This over-prediction is taken as an additional
systematic uncertainty, described in Section~\ref{sec:systematics}.

\section{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{sec:systematics}

Several sources of systematic uncertainty are considered when determining
the estimated signal and background contributions.
The largest sources of systematic uncertainty are those related to the
MC statistical uncertainty in the SRs, the JES, the $b$-tagging efficiency
and the extrapolation of the \ZGAMMAJETS\ background to high \HT. 
The uncertainty on the lepton energy scale and resolution was considered,
but shown to be negligible.

\begin{itemize}
%%
\item \textbf{Jet energy scale}:
The uncertainty on the JES takes into account the dependence on \pt, $\eta$,
jet flavor, and the number of primary vertices. The components of the JES
uncertainty are varied by $\pm1\sigma$ in the MC simulation and propagated to
the expected event yield.
%%
\item \textbf{$b$-tagging}:
The uncertainty on the $b$-tagging efficiency is evaluated by varying the
correction factors applied to each jet in the simulation within a range that
reflects the systematic uncertainty on the measured tagging and rejection
efficiencies. These uncertainties take into account the dependence on \pt and
jet flavor.
%%
\item \textbf{Jet energy resolution}:
  The uncertainty on the jet energy resolution (JER) is evaluated by
  applying an additional smearing to the \pt of each of the jets in the
  simulation. This smearing is then propagated to the expected event yield.
%%
\item \textbf{\HT\ extrapolation}:
An \HT\ extrapolation uncertainty of 50\% is applied to \ZGAMMAJETS\ events
with $\HT \geq 500$~\GeV. This is assigned to account for uncertainty on
the \ZGAMMAJETS\ \HT\ spectrum. This uncertainty is derived from the
disagreement observed in Figures~\ref{fig:pull_dist_vr}-\ref{fig:ht_vr}.
%%
\end{itemize}

Several theoretical uncertainties are considered in the modeling of the major
background processes in MC simulation. These include the uncertainty on the
single top ($Wt$) cross section, the uncertainty related to the renormalization
and factorization scales, parton shower, and the limited number of partons
included in the matrix element calculation. These theoretical uncertainties
are on the order of a few percent of the total background prediction. The
uncertainty on the luminosity is assessed for the signal processes, and all
background processes apart from \TTBAR\ and \ZGAMMAJETS, whose
normalizations are determined using data.
The relative systematic uncertainty on the total background estimate in the
SRs is shown in Table \ref{tab:systematic_breakdown}

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Summary of the effect of each considered sources of systematic
  uncertainty on the background estimate in SR~400 and SR~600. Several
  sources of theoretical systematic uncertainty which have a small

    \end{tabular}
}
\end{table}

For each of the signal models, the effects of uncertainty on the JES,
$b$-tagging efficiency, JER, and luminosity are considered as well as the
uncertainty on the signal model cross section which ranges between 14\%
and 28\%.

%% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The background yields in these signal regions are determined by a maximum
likelihood fit~\cite{Baak:2014wma} for the \TTBAR\ and
\ZGAMMAJETS\ normalizations, which are constrained by the observed data in the
Top and $Z$ CRs.
The systematic uncertainties described previously are included as
Gaussian-distributed nuisance parameters.
The fitted background yields and the observed number of events in each
signal region are shown in Tables~\ref{tab:event_yields_sr_400} and
\ref{tab:event_yields_sr_600}. Two events are observed, in agreement with
the Standard Model prediction.  The kinematics of the two selected events
are shown in Table~\ref{tab:sr_event_kinematics}, the $\MBL^0$ and
\HT\ distributions in SR 400 are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sr_dists}.

As the observed number of events is consistent with the Standard Model
prediction, Upper limits at 95\% confidence level (CL) on the number of
beyond the Standard Model (BSM) events for each signal region are derived
using the $CL_s$ prescription and neglecting any possible contamination in the
control regions. Normalizing these by the integrated luminosity of the data
sample they can be interpreted as upper limits on the visible BSM
cross section, $\sigma_\mathrm{vis}$, where $\sigma_\mathrm{vis}$ is defined
as the product of acceptance, reconstruction efficiency and production
cross section. The results are given in
Tables~\ref{tab:event_yields_sr_400}~and~\ref{tab:event_yields_sr_600}.

Exclusion limits on the signal model are determined using the $CL_S$
prescription based on a simultaneous fit of the SRs and
CRs~\cite{Baak:2014wma}. The predicted signal contamination is
taken into account in the CRs.  For each stop mass,
exclusion fits are performed with various assumptions on the branching
ratios of the stop. For each point on the branching ratio plane, the
SR which provided the best expected sensitivity, as
measured by the lowest expected $CL_S$ value, is chosen. The expected
and observed limits are shown in Figure \ref{fig:limit_contours}. This figure
shows, for each simulated stop mass, the observed (expected) 95\% exclusion
limit on the 
branching fraction under the red (blue) line. A yellow band shows the
$\pm 1\sigma$ uncertainty on the expected limit, determined from the
systematic uncertainty on the signal and background prediction excluding
the effect of the signal cross section uncertainty.  The effect of varying
the signal cross section on the observed limit is indicated by the dashed
red lines.  The final limit on the stop mass is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:mass_limit_obs}.  This plot shows the 95\% confidence
limit~(CL)
on the mass obtained by choosing the maximum excluded mass for each
branching ratio on the plane using the nominal cross section value.  
As the branching ratio of $\tilde{t} \rightarrow b\tau$ increases, the number
of expected events with electrons or muons in the final state decreases
for the same simulated stop mass. Therefore, the limit on the mass is
strongest at the bottom of the plane. In the top corner of the plot, the
SRs described in this analysis note have no sensitivity, however traditional
lepto-quark searches for final states with $b$-tagged jets and $\tau$ leptons
are able to place experimental limits in this region \cite{ATLAS:2013oea}.

    hypotheses between 400~\GeV and 1~\TeV. The shaded area under the solid
    line represents the branching ratios which are excluded at 95\% CL
    for each stop mass.
    The dotted lines represent the uncertainty on the observed mass limit
    obtained by varying the signal model cross section up and down one standard
    deviation from the nominal value. The dashed line shows the
    expected 95\% CL exclusion for each stop mass, and the shaded band shows
    the uncertainty on this expected exclusion limit from statistical
    uncertainty and the sources of systematic uncertainty discussed in
    Section~\ref{sec:systematics}.

  \caption{The observed mass limit on the stop at 95\% CL.
    This limit is obtained using the nominal stop cross section.
    Stop masses between 400~\GeV\ and 1100~\GeV, in steps of 100~\GeV, were
    tested. The mass limit shown corresponds to the highest-mass stop sample
    which was excluded.
    As the branching ratio of $\tilde{t} \rightarrow b\tau$ increases, the
    number of expected events with electrons or muons in the final state
    decreases. Therefore, the limit on the mass decreases.
