keep this brief by referencing as much as possible.
Certainly contrast assumption of RPC vs assumption of RPV for experimental
searches.
Both are possibilities.
Stop as LSP does give unique (crazy?) signature not well

Could have different

The universe, as we know it, comprises fundamental matter particles, and
four fundamental forces.
These forces include gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear
forces.
Despite being the weakest of the four forces, gravity is certainly the most
familiar to everyday life, as it assures objects fall to the ground.
The Gravitational force is described by the general theory of relativity, and
to this day, a successful quantum theory of gravity has yet to be developed.
Since gravity is so weak, it does not significantly affect the physics at the
LHC energy scale, and can safely be ignored for the purpose of this thesis.
Of the remaining three forces,  electromagnetism and the weak force have been
shown to come from the same underlying interactions, called the electroweak
force.
The electroweak and strong forces are described by the Standard Model of
Particle Physics.

In this chapter, a brief overview of the theoretical background for this thesis
is presented.
The Standard Model and its shortcomings are discussed
in \cref{sec:sm,sec:sm_shortcomings}.
Supersymmetry, a popular extension to the Standard Model, is introduced in
Section~\ref{sec:susy}.
The chapter concludes with a presentation of the particular $B-L$ extension to
the SM, which is the focus of the search presented in this dissertation.
Section~\ref{sec:theory_bl_extension} includes presents a brief description of
the underlying theory, as well as some of the interesting phenomenology expected
in the scenario where the scalar top is the LSP.

\section{Standard Model}
\label{sec:sm}

In this section, the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is described in
brief.
The SM is a very rich subject, and a more complete description can be found in
References~\cite{Agashe:2014kda,opac-b1131978,halzen1984quarks}.
The SM is a quantum field theory which encapsulates the current understanding
of the elementary particles, and their interactions, and has been developed,
and rigorously tested by experiments over the last fifty years.
In 2012, the final particle predicted by the SM, the ``Higgs boson`` was
discovered at CERN by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, marking a great
achievement for the both the experimental collaborations and the theorists
who predicted the particle's existence.
The SM Lagrangian is a non-abelian gauge theory with symmetry group 
$\mathrm{SU}(3)_\mathrm{C} \times
\mathrm{SU}(2)_\mathrm{L} \times
\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{Y}$,
which describes the matter content of the universe, as well as the interactions
of the strong and electroweak forces.
The matter content in the SM is made up of fermions (spin \nicefrac{1}{2}),
called quarks and leptons.
Massless gauge bosons (spin 1) mediate the interactions of the electroweak and
strong forces.

\subsection{Matter}
\label{sec:matter}

The fermionic matter is arranged into three families, or generations, each
containing quarks and leptons.
These particles can be charged under each part of the SM symmetry group,
where the particle's charge determines how it interacts with each of the
corces.
Each generation contains two chiral left-handed quarks, arranged in a isospin
doublet, consisting of an up-type and a down-type quark.
There are also two chiral left-handed leptons, one with electric charge, and
a neutrino, which is electrically neutral.
As with the quarks, the two left-handed leptons are arranged into an isospin
doublet.
Finally, each fermionic family contains chiral right-handed counterparts to
the two quarks, and the charged lepton.
No right-handed neutrinos are included in the SM, as they would no react with
any known forces, as will be explained shortly.
The right-handed fermions are isospin singlets.
The three generations are essentially copies of one another, differing only in
the mass of the constituent particles, and the familiar world is made up
entirely of particles from the first generation.
The reason for exactly three generations, not more or less, remains a mystery.
A summary of the SM matter content, with the charges under the various
parts of the SM symmetry group is shown in Table~\ref{tab:sm_matter_content}.

\begin{table}

    component of weak isospin $T_3$, hypercharge $Y$, and the allowable color
    charges.

\subsection{Quantum electrodynamics}
\label{sec:qed}

In addition to a charge, each piece of the SM symmetry group is associated with
a massless gauge boson, which mediates the interactions between particles.
The electroweak sector has the symmetry group
$\mathrm{SU}(2)_\mathrm{L} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{Y}$, and describes the
interactions with fields with isospin or hypercharge ($Y$) in a theory called
quantum electrodynamics (QED).
The electroweak sector is a chiral theory, meaning right- and left-handed
particles transform differently under the gauge group.
Left-handed fermions have a value of the third component of isospin equal to
$\pm \nicefrac{1}{2}$, while right-handed particles have no isospin, and do
not interact with the weak force.
The gauge bosons associated with the electroweak sector are three $W^{i}$
bosons, arranged in a weak isospin triplet, and a $B^0$ boson, which is a weak
isospin singlet.

Since chiral fields translate differently, depending on their chiral handedness,
there can be no mixing between the right- and left-handed states, which would
break gauge invariance.
Unfortunately, a mass term, allows for exactly this mixing, implying the
fermions, as well as the gauge bosons must be massless.
On the other hand, the weak force is observed to be short ranged, implying
massive gauge bosons, and fermions do indeed have measurable masses.
Adding masses to a chiral quantum field theory is a difficult endeavor, and
is achieved through a process called ``spontaneous symmetry breaking,'' which
is explained in Section~\ref{sec:higgs}.
The broken symmetry leads to a mixing of the $W^3$ and $B^0$ gauge bosons into
a massless photon, and the massive $Z$ boson.
The $W^1$ and $W^2$ become the massive $W^{+}$ and $W^{-}$.
The $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons both have mass, and act as the propagator of the
weak force, while the massless photon mediates the electromagnetic force.

Since right-handed neutrinos have no charge under any part of the SM symmetry
group, they are not expected to interact with the known components of the SM,
and are therefore not included as part of the theory.
There are extensions to the SM, however, which do include right-handed
neutrinos, including the one described in Section~\ref{sec:theory_bl_extension}.

%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Quantum chromodynamics}
\label{sec:qcd}

The $\mathrm{SU}(3)_\mathrm{C}$ part of the SM Lagrangian corresponds to the
strong force, with a corresponding ``color'' charge, and is described by the
theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD).
Quarks are colored objects, having red, green, or blue charge, while leptons
have no color charge, and thus do not interact directly with the strong
force.
The eight massless gauge bosons associated with the
$\mathrm{SU}(3)_\mathrm{C}$ symmetry group are called gluons, and are
themselves colored objects.
This leads to self interaction, and some interesting phenomenology!

Because the gluon are allowed to interact with one another, QED and QCD have
some very important differences.
Perhaps, the most interesting, is related to the concept of ``screening''.
In QED, as one moves further from a charged paricle, the charge tends to look
smaller as a result of the polarization of the vacuum around the charge, where
electron pairs pop out of the vacuum.
The further from the particle one is, the more electron pairs are visible,
obscuring the initial charge more.
In QCD, this same screening effect occurs, with quark-anti-quark pairs being
pair-produced from the vacuum, however gluon pairs may also be produced out of
the vacuum.
These gluon pairs produce the opposite screening effect, known as
``anti-screening,'' increasing the effective charge observed.
Rather than charges being screened, as in QED, there is a net anti-screening
effect for objects with color charge.

As two colored particles get very close together, the anti-screening is very
small, and they can be treated as free particles, in an effect known as
``asymptotic freedom.''
Alternatively, as two charged particles move apart, the polarization of the
vacuum between them results in an increasing energy buildup, until it is
energetically favorable to pair produce a quark-anti-quark pair from the vacuum.
For this reason, no free quarks or gluons have been observed, rather any
objects with color charge will tend to into bound states called ``hadrons,''
which has no net color.
Hadrons can either be a bound state of a quark-anti-quark pair, called mesons,
or three-quark bound states, called baryons.
The anti-quark contained in a meson must have the corresponding anti-color of 
the constituent quark.
Similarly, the three quarks, which make up a baryon, must have colors that add
to ``white,'' meaning one red , one green, and one blue quark.

In particle collisions, this effect also leads to the phenomenon of ``jets,''
where a spray of hadrons is projected at the particle detector, resulting from
the multiple colored objects being pulled apart due to the energy of the
collision.

\subsection{Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism}
\label{sec:higgs}

As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:qed}, the fermions and gauge bosons described
in the SM Lagrangian are massless, however, many of those observed in nature
do, in fact, have a non-negligible mass.
This would seem to allow for the mixing of chiral left- and right-handed
fields, which would in turn break gauge invariance.
A method to add mass terms to the SM Lagrangian without breaking the necessary
gauge invariance was developed during the 1960's by several groups of theorists,
including Robert Brout and Francois Englert~\cite{PhysRevLett.13.321},
Peter Higgs~\cite{Higgs1964132,PhysRevLett.13.508},
and Gerald Guralnik, Carl R. Hagen, and Tom Kibble~\cite{PhysRevLett.13.585}
working in parallel, and is commonly called the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH)
mechanism.
The BEH mechanism adds an additional complex scaler field to the Lagrangian,
which acquires a vacuum expectation value (vev), which ``spontaneously''
breaks the symmetry of the SM Lagrangian.

Each spontaneously broken symmetry leads to new massive scalar particle, know
as a ``Goldstone boson.''
The gauge bosons can then absorb these Goldstone bosons in a process where they
acquire a mass.
Recall, before symmetry breaking, the electroweak sector has four massless
gauge bosons, the $W^1$, $W^2$,  $W^3$, and the $B^0$, however experiments
observe massive $W^{\pm}$, and the $Z$ bosons, associated with the weak force,
and a massless photon to mediate the electromagnetic force.
An electric charge $Q$ is also conserved.
This implies that the
$\mathrm{SU}(2)_\mathrm{L} \times \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{Y}$ of QED is broken in
a way that leaves only a $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{EM}$ symmetry group.
This symmetry breaking requires at least three Goldstone bosons to be absorbed,
and give masses to the gauge bosons.
The simplest method to accomplish this is to add a complex scalar field
\begin{equation}
  \Phi = \begin{pmatrix} \phi^+ \\ \phi^0 \end{pmatrix},
    \label{eqn:scalar_field}
\end{equation}
which is a doublet with positive hypercharge ($Y=\nicefrac{1}{2}$).

To show how this, it is useful to consider the SM Lagrangian, ignoring the
QCD part,
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L} =
  - \frac{1}{4} W_{\mu\nu}^{a} W_{a}^{\mu\nu}
  - \frac{1}{4} B_{\mu\nu} B^{\mu\nu}
  + \bar{L}_i \left(i D_{\mu} \gamma^{\mu} \right) L_i
  + \bar{e}_{\mathrm{R},i}\left(i D_{\mu} \gamma^{\mu}\right)e_{\mathrm{R},i},
\end{equation}
where the $i$ index runs over the three generations, the $\mu$,$\nu$ are
Lorentz indices, and $a$ runs over the generators in the gauge group.
The field strengths are given by
\begin{eqnarray}
  W_{\mu\nu}^{a} & = &
  \partial_{\mu}W_{\nu}^{a} - 
  \partial_{\nu}W_{\mu}^{a} +
  g_{2}\epsilon^{abc}W_{\mu}^{b}W_{\nu}^{c}
  \\
  B_{\mu\nu} & = &
  \partial_{\mu}B_{\nu} - 
  \partial_{\nu}B_{\mu},
\end{eqnarray}
and the covariant derivatives for the left- and right-handed lepton fields are
\begin{eqnarray}
  D_{\mu}L_\mathrm{L} & = &
  \left(
    \partial_{\mu} - ig_{2}T_{a}W_{\mu}^{a} - ig_{1}YB_{\mu}
  \right) L_\mathrm{L}
  \\
  D_{\mu}e_\mathrm{R} & = &
  \left(
    \partial_{\mu} - ig_{1}YB_{\mu}
  \right) e_\mathrm{R}.
\end{eqnarray}
$T_a$ are the generators of the gauge group, and $g_1$ and $g_2$ are the
coupling constants for electroweak interactions.

Adding the complex scalar field from Equation~\ref{eqn:scalar_field} adds an
additional scalar part to the Lagrangian,
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L} =
  \left(D^{\mu}\Phi\right)^{\dagger}\left(D_{\mu}\Phi\right) - V(\Phi),
  \label{eqn:scalar_lagrangian}
\end{equation}
where the first term is the kinetic term, and $V(\Phi)$ is the scalar
potential.
The exact form of the scalar potential is not known, however, the simplest
possible form that has the desired properties can be used
\begin{equation}
  V(\Phi) = \mu^2 \Phi^{\dagger}\Phi + \lambda\left(\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi\right)^2.
\end{equation}
This form is an assumption that provides the required spontaneous symmetry
breaking, while remaining renormalizable.
In order for the vacuum to be stable, $\lambda$ must be positive.
The choice of the $\mu^2$ parameter affects the shape of the scalar potential,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:symmetry_breaking}.
In the configuration with $\mu^2 > 0$, the scalar potential is always positive,
and the minimum occurs at
\begin{equation}
  \bra{0} \Phi \ket{0} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
There is no spontaneous symmetry is this scenario.
On the other hand, if $\mu^2 < 0$, the scalar potential takes on the famous
``Mexican hat'' shape, and the minimum of the potential is no longer located at
the origin.
With the minimum of the scalar potential located away from the origin, the
neutral part of the scalar field acquires a vacuum expectation value (vev) $v$,
\begin{equation}
  \bra{0} \Phi \ket{0} =
  \Phi_0 =
  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}} \end{pmatrix},
  v = \sqrt{\frac{-\mu^2}{\lambda}}.
\end{equation}
By acquiring a vev, electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken.
The charged component of the scalar field cannot acquire a vev, otherwise
electromagnetism is not conserved.

      \caption{The scalar potential under two configurations.
        The configuration on the top shows the case where $\mu^2 > 0$, where
        the scalar potential is always positive.
        In this configuration, the scalar potential has a minimum at the origin.
        The configuration with $\mu^2 < 0$ is shown on the bottom.
        In this case, the minimum of the scalar potential occurs away from the
        origin.
        In this scenario, the scalar field moves away from the origin, in a
        process of spontaneous symmetry breaking.
        The green line corresponds to the circle of minimum potential,
        corresponding to the massless Goldstone
      mode~\cite{QuantumDiariesHiggs}}.
  \label{fig:symmetry_breaking}
\end{figure}

Expanding the scalar field $\Phi$ around it's minimum $\Phi_0$, one gets
\begin{equation}
  \Phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ v + H(x) \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
with $H(x)$ being a new scalar field.
Inserting this into the kinetic term of Equation~\ref{eqn:scalar_lagrangian},
and redefining the gauge fields as
\begin{eqnarray}
  W_{\mu}^{\pm} & = & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
                      \left( W_{\mu}^{1} \mp W_{\mu}^{2} \right),
  \\
  Z_{\mu} & = & \frac{1}{\sqrt{g_1^2 + g_2^2}}
                \left( g_2 W_{\mu}^{3} - g_1 B_{\mu} \right),
  \\
  A_{\mu} & = & \frac{1}{\sqrt{g_1^2 + g_2^2}}
                \left( g_2 W_{\mu}^{3} + g_1 B_{\mu} \right),
\end{eqnarray}
where the redefined gauge fields correspond to the physical gauge bosons
of QED, the $W^{\pm}$, $Z$, and the photon.
The covariant derivative becomes
\begin{equation}
  \left| D_{\mu}\Phi \right|^2 =
  \frac{1}{2} \left( \partial_{\mu} H \right)^2 +
  \frac{1}{2} g_{2}^{2} \left(v + H\right)^2 W_{\mu}^{+}W^{\mu -} +
  \frac{1}{8} \left(v + H\right)^2 \left(g_{1}^{2} + g_{2}^{2} \right)
    Z_{\mu}Z^{\mu}.
\end{equation}
It can be seen that the gauge bosons take on the following masses through their
interactions with the scalar field
\begin{eqnarray}
  M_{W} &=& \frac{1}{2} v g_2 \\
  M_{Z} &=& \frac{1}{2} v \sqrt{g_1^2 + g_2^2} \\
  M_{A} &=& 0
\end{eqnarray}
It is important to note that there is no term for the photon, implying it does
not interact with the scalar field, and therefore, does not pick up a mass
term.
Three of the degrees of freedom from the scalar field that would be Goldstone
bosons have been absorbed by the gauge bosons, giving them mass.
There is one remaining degree of freedom, which becomes the Higgs boson.
The Higgs boson itself has mass, equal to
\begin{eqnarray}
  m_H &=& 2 \lambda v^2 \\
      &=& 2\mu^2.
\end{eqnarray}
This mass corresponds to the remaining degree of freedom in the scalar
potential, where the field can oscillate in the radial direction, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:higgs_mass}.
The Higgs mass has no other handles in the SM, and must be determined
experimentally.
It was found to be equal to
$125.02^{+0.22}_{0.27}\mathrm{(stat)}^{+0.14}_{-0.15}\mathrm{(syst)} \GeV$
by the ATLAS and CMS experiments.

\subsection{R-Parity}
\label{sec:r_parity}

The extension of the Standard Model of particle physics with
supersymmetry (SUSY)~\cite{Miyazawa:1966,Ramond:1971gb,Golfand:1971iw,
Neveu:1971rx,Neveu:1971iv,Gervais:1971ji,Volkov:1973ix,Wess:1973kz,Wess:1974tw}
immediately leads to processes that violate both baryon number ($B$) and
lepton number ($L$), leading to rapid proton decay and
lepton-number-violating processes, such as unseen decays of
$\mu \to e\gamma$, in conflict with experimental bounds.
A conventional assumption to prevent these processes is to impose
conservation of $R$-parity~\cite{Fayet:1976et,Fayet:1977yc,Farrar:1978xj,
Fayet:1979sa,Dimopoulos:1981zb},
defined as $R=(-1)^{3(B-L)+2s}$ where $s$ is the spin of the particle.
This has a value of $+1$ for Standard Model particles and $-1$ for
SUSY particles.
In this case SUSY particles are produced in pairs, and the LSP is stable.
Further, this stable LSP cannot carry electric charge or color charge without
coming into conflict with astrophysical data.
At the LHC, the conventional experimental signature for SUSY particles
includes significant missing transverse momentum due to the non-interaction of
the LSP with the detector.

\subsection{Motivation}

{\color{red} Why this model? :-) Talk about things like:
\begin{itemize}
\item RPC is overkill to prevent proton decay
\item Links neutrino sector to susy properties
\end{itemize}
}

An alternative approach is to add a local symmetry $\mathrm{U}(1)_{B-L}$ to the
$\mathrm{SU}(3)_\mathrm{C} \times
\mathrm{SU}(2)_\mathrm{L} \times
\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{Y}$ Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos.
The minimal supersymmetric extension then only needs a vacuum expectation value
for a right-handed sneutrino in order to spontaneously break the

Braun:2006ae, Ambroso:2009jd, Ambroso:2010pe, Ovrut:2012wg}.
This minimal $B-L$ model violates lepton number but not baryon number, and is
consistent with proton stability and the bounds on lepton number violation.
The LSP can now decay via $R$-parity-violating (RPV) processes, and may now
carry color and electric charge.

\subsection{Phenomenology}

This leads to unique signatures~\cite{FileviezPerez:2012mj, Perez:2013kla,
Ovrut:2012wg, Ovrut:2014rba, Ovrut:2015uea} that are disallowed in conventional
models with $R$-parity conservation.
The case where the LSP is a scalar top (stop) is most interesting
since, in general, the large mass of the top quark acts to make the
lightest stop significantly lighter than the other squarks due to
renormalization group effects~\cite{Barbieri:1987fn,deCarlos:1993yy}.
The stop decays via an RPV interaction to a charged lepton (of any
flavor) and a $b$-quark.
The decay branching fractions to $e b$, $\mu b$, and $\tau b$ may be different,
in a manner related to the neutrino mass
hierarchy seen in Figure~\ref{fig:pheno_bounds}.
Each point in this plot represents a simulation with a particular choice of
model parameters, all varied within a natural range of values, shown in
Table~\ref{tab:pheno_ranges}, and the four colors represent different choices
for the neutrino mass hierarchy and 
$\sin^2\theta_{23}$~\cite{Marshall:2014cwa,Marshall:2014kea}.
There is a clear relation between the neutrino mass hierarchy and the allowed
stop branching ratios, therefore if a stop consistent with this model is
discovered, its properties could potentially give information about the
structure of the neutrino sector.

Within this model, a stop LSP can decay in one of two ways, depending on
the handedness of the stop.
A right-handed stop decays to a top quark and a right-handed neutrino with a
coupling strength proportional to vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the
left-handed neutrino mass.
This must be small because the left-handed sneutrino interacts with the
$W$ and $Z$ bosons, and a large VEV would result in these bosons gaining
additional mass.
{\color{red} (TODO check this statement is true - I think I'm missing
something).}
A purely left-handed stop decays to a $b$-quark and a lepton with the coupling
strength proportional to the VEV of the right-handed sneutrino, which may be
large, as the right-handed sneutrino does not couple to the electroweak bosons,
a large VEV does not break electroweak symmetry.
{\color{red} (TODO check this statement is true - I think I'm missing
something)}.
In the scenario where the stop LSP is an admixture of left- and right-handed
stops, the preferred decay mode depends on the stop mixing angle ($\theta_t$).
This dependence is plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:stop_br_vs_mixing_angle}, which
shows the ratio
$\nicefrac{\mathrm{Br}(\stop \to t\nu)}{\mathrm{Br}(\stop \to b\ell)}$
versus $\theta_t$.
Each point represents a simulation with a particular choice of model parameters,
again scanning over the natural values in Table~\ref{tab:pheno_ranges}.
The $\stop \to b\ell$ decay is the dominant decay mode for mixing angles less
than abut $80^{\circ}$, where the LSP stop is mostly right handed, and the
$\stop \to t\nu$ decay becomes significance.
The $\stop \to b\ell$ decay is still non-negligible for a mostly right-handed
stop in many of the simulated models,
however~\cite{Marshall:2014cwa,Marshall:2014kea}.

      values~\cite{Marshall:2014cwa}.

The analysis described in this thesis focuses on the $\stop \to b\ell$ decay
as it is preferred for most of parameter space.
Additionally, if the $\stop \to t\nu$ decay is significant, the decay of stop
pairs would lead to final states with $t\bar{t}$ associated with large missing
energy, which is the same final state as stop pair production with
$R$-Parity conserving decays, and the limits from traditional stop searches can
be reinterpreted for this model.

It is also reasonable to assume the stop decays in this model are prompt, and
decay with a negligible impact parameter, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:stop_decay_length_vs_mixing_angle}, where for most natural
models, the stop is expected to have a decay length of less than
$10^{-3}~\mathrm{mm}$;
in particular, this is true for models where the stop is not mostly
right-handed ($\theta_t \leq 80$)~\cite{Marshall:2014cwa,Marshall:2014kea}.
Therefore, long-lived particles are not considered in this analysis.

In this $B-L$ extension to the MSSM, stop pair production has the same
production cross section as in the traditional MSSM.
The expected production cross section are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stop_xsec}.

\subsection{Previous results}

The results from existing leptoquark searches performed at ATLAS were
re-interpreted in the context of this $B-L$ SUSY model with a stop LSP, and the
limits obtained on the minimum allowable stop mass across the plane of
physical stop branching ratios are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:pheno_limit}~\cite{Marshall:2014cwa,Marshall:2014kea}.
The leptoquark searches, used to obtain these mass limits, searched for
models where the decay products are in the same generation.
As a result, $b$-tagging is only required in events associated with a $\tau$
lepton, and events with a light lepton simply require a jet, regardless of the
flavor.
Additionally, previous leptoquark searches only consider decays to a single
lepton flavor, resulting in final states with either two leptons of the same
flavor and two jets, or a single charged lepton and at least one jet.
The previous analyses did not consider final states with two charged leptons
with different flavors ($e\mu$) and at least two 
jets~\cite{ATLAS:2013oea, ATLAS:2012aq, Aad:2011ch, CMS:2014qpa,
  Chatrchyan:2012sv, Chatrchyan:2012vza, Chatrchyan:2012st}.
A dedicated search requiring $b$-tagged jets associated with light leptons
(electrons and muons), and considering different flavored leptons in the final
state can provide additional sensitivity to this model, as well as other models
which result in final states with $b$-quarks and light leptons in the final
state.
