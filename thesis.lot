For the inclusive sample, only events with $\ensuremath {p_{\mathrm {T}}}^{Z} \le 40 \textrm {Ge\kern -0.1em V}$ were used. For each \ensuremath {p_{\mathrm {T}}}\ slice, nine samples were generated, with different lepton flavor channels and filters applied on the jet flavor. The three samples are generated with the same cross section, but different filter efficiencies, leading to different effective luminosities. The three columns under the effective luminosity represent the three samples. The left column shows the effective luminosity for the sample generated with a $b$-filter.
